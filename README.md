# ChorusMod
A Cataclysm Bright Nights mod of my own design. Mostly just to experiment and figure things out. Suggestions and criticisms always welcome!
The Gear addon is the most comprehensive, and adds in and changes a number of items, but it's not really a cohesive narrative.
The CBMs addon is the next largest, and it similarly adds in new CBMs and edits existing ones.
The primitive mod mostly just adds in things from Primal World, but without removing cities and such. Don't use alongside it.
The Martial Arts mod adds in new meme martial arts styles, which feel moderately balanced, but I'm always open to suggestions.
The Starts mod adds in new professions and starts, and similarly to the martial arts mod, many of them are meme-y.
